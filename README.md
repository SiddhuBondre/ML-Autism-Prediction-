# üß† Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Prediction

# üìå Overview

This project predicts whether an individual is likely to have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning models.
The dataset includes 10 screening questions (AQ-10 test) along with demographic details such as gender, ethnicity, country of residence, and medical history indicators.


# üìÇ Dataset Information

Source: Autism Screening Dataset (Kaggle / UCI)

Total Columns: 22

Target Variable: Class/ASD

Sample Columns:

ID: Unique identifier

A1_Score to A10_Score: Binary scores from AQ-10 autism test (0 or 1)

gender: Male (m) or Female (f)

ethnicity: Ethnic background

jaundice: Whether the individual had jaundice at birth (yes/no)

austim: Family history of autism (yes/no)

contry_of_res: Country of residence

used_app_before: Whether the person has used the autism screening app before

result: AQ-10 total score

age_desc: Age category description (e.g., "18 and more")

relation: Relation of respondent (Self, Parent, etc.)

Class/ASD: Final classification (1 = ASD, 0 = No ASD)
